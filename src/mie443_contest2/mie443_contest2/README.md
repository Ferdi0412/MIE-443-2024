# Contest 2
Here we are building files to traverse an unknown environtment, to move and image targets at known locations.

## Header files
Add these to the [include](include) directory.

## Function files
Add these to the [src](src) directory.

## Testing
To test, modify the [src/priv-test.cpp](src/priv-test.cpp) file. This will **NOT** be commited to Git, and so you have free range to do with it as you like.

```shell
rosrun mie443_contest2 priv_test
```
